TrailMaster App
======

Background
---
Runners equipped with modern GPS devices produce a tremendous amount of geolocation data regarding their activities.  Especially for trail running, this data is potentially immensely useful to organizations interested in planning courses for future running events; however, the data is held in the hands of individual runners and no central database of worthwhile running routes exists.

TrailMaster aims to fill this gap by providing a central database of geoJSON data relevant to running organizations planning new courses for new events.  The database stores both Points of Interest (such as start/finish lines, turn around points, etc.), and also Routes (such as off-road or unmarked trails) and the App gives users an interface to build new collections, or Trails, of this data and view them on a map (thus creating a map of a new potential course).
