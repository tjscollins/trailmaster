# TrailMaster App

##Background

Runners equipped with modern GPS devices produce a tremendous amount of geolocation data regarding their activities.  Especially for trail running, this data is potentially immensely useful to organizations interested in planning courses for future running events; however, the data is held in the hands of individual runners and no central database of worthwhile running routes exists.

TrailMaster aims to fill this gap by providing a central database of geoJSON data relevant to running organizations planning new courses for new events.  The database stores both Points of Interest (such as start/finish lines, turn around points, etc.), and also Routes (such as off-road or unmarked trails) and the App gives users an interface to build new collections, or Trails, of this data and view them on a map (thus creating a map of a new potential course).

## Building New Trails

Creating a saving new Trails, which are combinations of existing points of interest and routes, requires making an account in the app.  Once you have an account, and you have selected the points of interest and routes you wish to save together, simply click 'Save New Trail' in the Trails section of the controls.


## Contributing New Points of Interest and Routes

There are two primary methods of contributing new data to trail master.  These are:

### From a GPS-capable Mobile Device

When the application is accessed from a GPS-capable mobile device, it will display two additional buttons in the controls:  a 'Save New Point of Interest' button and a 'Track New Route' button.

Each will use the mobile device's built-in GPS functionality to directly add new data to the TrailMaster application.

###### Warning:  The 'Track New Route' feature only works while the device's display is active.  Locking your screen will cause the device to stop tracking.  

### Import a GPX File

If you have a GPS-capable athletic device (such as a Garmin Forerunner or similar device), you can export GPS data in the form of a GPX file from that device.  See your device manufacturer's instructions for how to export data.

Once you have the GPX file, simply open it in a text editor (such as Notepad) and copy and paste its contents into TrailMaster's import form.
